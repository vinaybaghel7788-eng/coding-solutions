# Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, return  *the  **greatest common divisor**  of the smallest number and largest number in* `nums`.

The  **greatest common divisor**  of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 2.
The largest number in nums is 10.
The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [7,5,6,8,3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 8.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 8 is 1.

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The smallest number in nums is 3.
The largest number in nums is 3.
The greatest common divisor of 3 and 3 is 3.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 2 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000

class Solution {
public:
    int findGCD(vector<int>& nums) {
        int smallest = *min_element(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        int largest = *max_element(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        return gcd(smallest,largest);  
    }
};
```
