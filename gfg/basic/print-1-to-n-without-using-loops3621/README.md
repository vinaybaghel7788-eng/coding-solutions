## Problem

Given an positive integer, print numbers from 1 to without using loops.

Implement the function `printTillN()` to print the numbers from 1 to as space-separated integers.

**Examples
**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 5.
```

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Explanation: We have to print numbers from 1 to 10.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 1000

class Solution {
  public:
    void printTillN(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n==0)
        return ;
        
        printTillN(n-1);
        cout << n << " ";
    }
};
```
