## Problem

### Odd Even

An array $B$ is called good if the parity of the elements keep alternating, i.e. odd, even, odd,.... or even, odd, even,...

You are given an array $A$ containing $N$ integers, and you can do the following action:

- Choose some subset of elements of $A$, and then rearrange that subset to form a good array.

Find the maximum size of subset you can choose which can be rearranged to a good array.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains $N$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum size of a subset.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le A_i \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
5
1 3 7 4 5
4
1 1 2 4

```

```
3
4
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  We can choose the subset $\{1, 4, 5\}$. There is no need to reorder it, as it is already alternating.

 **Test Case 2:**  We can choose the subset $\{1, 1, 2, 4\}$ and reorder to get $[1, 2, 1, 4]$ which is alternating parity.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,n;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> n;
        int odd =0, even =0;
        
        for(int i =0; i<n; i++){
            int x;
            cin >> x;
            
            if(x % 2 == 0){
                even++;
            } else {
                odd++;
            }
        }
        int ans = 2*min(odd,even) + 1;
        
        ans = min(ans,n);
        
        cout << ans << endl;
    }
	

}

```
