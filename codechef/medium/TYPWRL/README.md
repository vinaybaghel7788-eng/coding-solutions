## Problem

### Typing World

Nikhil is analyzing typing ergonomics for a new custom keyboard layout. He wants to measure the continuous strain placed on a typist's individual hands.

You are given a string $S$ representing a word Nikhil wants to type. You are also given a string $L$ containing distinct characters, representing all the keys on the keyboard that must be pressed using the left hand. Any letter which is not present in $L$ must be typed with the right hand.

Calculate the maximum number of consecutive key presses made by the same hand while typing the word $S$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $M$, denoting the lengths of $S$ and $L$, respectively. The second line contains a string $S$ of length $N$, consisting of lowercase English letters, denoting the word to be typed. The third line contains a string $L$ of length $M$, consisting of distinct lowercase English letters, denoting the keys assigned to the left hand.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of consecutive key presses made by the same hand.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 1000$
- $1 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le M \le 26$
- Strings $S$ and $L$ contain lowercase English letters only, i.e. a, b, c,..., z.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
8 14
codechef
qwertasdfgzxcv
5 1
abcde
a
3 26
xyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

```

```
3
4
3

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The left hand types the letters $\texttt{qwertasdfgzxcv}$, so the letters of $\texttt{codechef}$ are typed by the hands $\texttt{L, R, L, L, L, R, L, L}$ in order. The longest block of consecutive letters typed by the same hand is $\texttt{dec}$ (left hand), of length $3$.

 **Test case $2$:**  Only $\texttt{a}$ is typed by the left hand, so $\texttt{bcde}$ are all typed by the right hand, giving a block of length $4$.

 **Test case $3$:**  All $26$ letters are typed by the left hand, so the whole word $\texttt{xyz}$ is typed by one hand, giving length $3$.
