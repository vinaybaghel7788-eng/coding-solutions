# SKIPONE

## Problem

### Skip one

You have $K$ coins with you, and up ahead are $N$ items. The $i$-th item costs you $A_i$ coins to buy.

You also have a special one-time only discount coupon, which can be used to make one item of your choice free to buy.

You have a special constraint that you can buy items in the order $1, 2, \ldots, N$, and if you choose to not buy some item, you cannot buy the later ones either.

Find the maximum number of items you can buy under these constraints.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains $2$ integers $N$ and $K$. The second line contains $N$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum items you can buy.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10^4$
- $2 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 10^4$
- $1 \le K \le 10^9$

```

2 5
7 7
4 4
100 2 1 1

```

```

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  We can buy the first $5$ items, using a discount token on the fifth, spending a total of $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$ coins on the others. Note that we cannot buy the $7$th item even though we have the coins left for it, because we are forced to buy the $6$th first.

 **Test Case 2:**  We do not have enough coins for any items, but we can still use our discount token for the first.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,n,k;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> n >> k;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}
