# SEATING7

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

### Seating

There are $N$ seats numbered $1$, $2$, $\ldots$, $N$, and $M$ of them are already occupied - seats numbered $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_M$.

$K$ more people will enter one by one, and each of them will occupy the lowest numbered seat that is available. For each of these $K$ people, find the seat number where they will seat.

It is guaranteed that there are at least $K$ seats empty.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line contains $3$ integers - $N$, $M$ and $K$. The second line contains $M$ integers - $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_M$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line $K$ integers - the seat numbers where each of the new people will sit, in order.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $2 \le N \le 100$
- $1 \le M, K \le N$
- $M + K \le N$
- $1 \le A_i \le N$
- $A_i \lt A_{i + 1}$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
4 2 2
1 3
6 2 3
3 4
5 1 1
5

```

```
2 4
1 2 5
1
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Person $1$ comes and notices seat $1$ is already taken, and so sits in seat numbered $2$. Person $2$ comes and notices seats $1$, $2$ and $3$ are taken, and hence sits in $4$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int T;
    cin >> T;

    while (T--) {
        int N, M, K;
        cin >> N >> M >> K;

        vector<bool> occupied(N + 1, false);

        
        for (int i = 0; i < M; i++) {
            int x;
            cin >> x;
            occupied[x] = true;
        }

        
        for (int person = 0; person < K; person++) {
            for (int seat = 1; seat <= N; seat++) {
                if (!occupied[seat]) {
                    cout << seat << " ";
                    occupied[seat] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
