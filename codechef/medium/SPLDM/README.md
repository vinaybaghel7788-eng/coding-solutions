## Problem

### Splash Damage

You are playing a video game, where the current level has $N$ monsters in a row. The $i$-th monster from the left has $A_i$ health.
It is guaranteed that $1 \le A_i \le 3$.

A monster is said to be  *alive*  if it has a positive amount of health remaining, and  *dead*  otherwise.

You have a grenade launcher, with which you can do the following:

- Choose a monster $i$ that is currently alive, and launch a grenade at it.
- This will instantly reduce the health of monster $i$ to $0$, turning it dead.
- Further, monsters $i-1$ and $i+1$ will both lose $1$ health each, if they exist and are alive.

You would like to play the game for as long as possible.
Thus, your task is to find the  **maximum**  number of times that you can use the grenade launcher before all monsters are dead.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ — the number of monsters. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of times you can use the grenade launcher before all monsters are dead.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $1 \le A_i \le 3$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There are two monsters next to each other, each with $1$ health.
If we fire a grenade at either monster, the splash damage will reduce the health of the other one to $0$ as well.
So, the grenade launcher can only be used once.

 **Test case $2$:**  One way of launching three grenades is:

- First, target monster $4$. This will kill both monsters $3$ and $4$, the resulting health values are $[1, 2, 0, 0]$.
- Next, target monster $1$. This will kill it, and reduce monster $2$'s health by $1$. The resulting health values are $[0, 1, 0, 0]$.
- Finally, target monster $2$, killing it.

It can be verified that there's no way to use the launcher more than $3$ times before every monster is dead.
