## Problem

### Buying Eggs

You want to buy $12$ eggs.

There are two shops that sell eggs.

- The first shop is nearby, and sells eggs at a cost of $X$ coins each.
- The second shop is far away, and sells eggs at a cost of $Y$ coins each. However, since the second shop is far away, you also need to pay an additional $F$ coins in fuel costs to reach it.

Find the minimum possible cost of buying $12$ eggs.

### Input Format
- The first and only line of input will contain three space-separated integers $X, Y,$ and $F$ — the costs of eggs in the first and second shops, and the fuel cost.
### Output Format

Output a single integer: the minimum cost of buying $12$ eggs.

### Constraints
- $1 \le X, Y, F \le 20$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5 8 3

```

```
60
```

### Explanation:

Buying $12$ eggs from the first shop has a cost of $5\cdot 12 = 60$ coins.
Buying $12$ eggs from the second shop has a cost of $8\cdot 12 = 96$ coins, with an additional $F=3$ in fuel costs for a total of $99$.

It's better to buy from the first shop, spending $60$ coins.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
10 4 5

```

```
53
```

### Explanation:

Buying $12$ eggs from the first shop has a cost of $10\cdot 12 = 120$ coins.
Buying $12$ eggs from the second shop has a cost of $4\cdot 12 = 48$ coins, with an additional $F=5$ in fuel costs for a total of $53$.

It's better to buy from the second shop, spending $53$ coins.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x,y,f;
    cin >> x >> y >> f; 
    int total_cost1 = 12*x;
    int total_cost2 = 12*y +f;
    
    if(total_cost2>total_cost1){
        cout << total_cost1 << endl;
    } else{
        cout << total_cost2 << endl;
    }
    return 0;
	// your code goes here

}
