## Problem

### Minimum number of coins

Chef has infinite coins in denominations of rupees $5$ and rupees $10$.

Find the  **minimum**  number of coins Chef needs, to pay  **exactly**  $X$ rupees. If it is impossible to pay $X$ rupees in denominations of rupees $5$ and $10$ only, print $-1$.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single integer $X$.
### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer - the  **minimum**  number of coins Chef needs, to pay  **exactly**  $X$ rupees. If it is impossible to pay $X$ rupees in denominations of rupees $5$ and $10$ only, print $-1$.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X \leq 1000$
### Subtasks
- Subtask 1 (100 points): Original constraints.

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Chef would require at least $5$ coins to pay $50$ rupees. All these coins would be of rupees $10$.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef would require at least $2$ coins to pay $15$ rupees. Out of these, $1$ coin would be of rupees $10$ and $1$ coin would be of rupees $5$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve() {
    int x;
    cin >> x;
    
    if(x%5 != 0){
        cout << "-1"<< endl;
    } else{
        cout << (x+5)/10 << endl;
    }

}

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        solve();
    }
    return 0;
    
}

```
