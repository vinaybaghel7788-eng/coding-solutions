## Problem

### Chef and Gym

Chef has decided to join a Gym in ChefLand and if possible, also hire a personal trainer at the gym. The monthly cost of the gym is $X$ and personal training will cost him an additional $Y$ per month. Chef's total budget per month is only $Z$. Print `1` if Chef can only join the gym, `2` if he can also have a personal trainer, and `0` if he can't even join the gym.

 **Note**  that if Chef wants to hire a personal trainer, he  *must*  join the gym — he cannot hire the trainer without joining the gym.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing three space-separated integers $X, Y, Z$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line `2` if Chef can go to the gym and have a trainer, `1` if Chef can only go to the gym, `0` if he can't even go to the gym.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X,Y,Z \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
1 2 3
10 12 13
23 1 22
23 1 63
```

```
2
1
0
2
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since the total cost of Chef getting a gym membership and a trainer is $1+2 = 3$ which is equal to his budget of $3$, Chef can get both a gym membership and a trainer.

 **Test case $2$:**  Since the total cost of Chef getting a gym membership and a trainer is $10+12 = 22$ which is greater than his budget of $13$, he can't get both a gym membership and a trainer. However, the cost of the gym membership is $10$ which is less than his budget of $13$, so Chef can get only a gym membership.

 **Test case $3$:**  Since the cost of Chef getting a gym membership is $23$ which is greater than his budget of $22$, Chef can't even get the gym membership.

 **Test case $4$:**  The same costs as the previous test, but this time Chef has enough money to afford both the membership and a personal trainer.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,x,y,z;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> x >> y >> z;
        if(x+y <= z){
            cout << "2" << endl;
        } else if(z>=x){
            cout << "1" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "0" << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
	// your code goes here

}
