## Problem

### Mutated Minions

Gru has not been in the limelight for a long time and is, therefore, planning something particularly nefarious. Frustrated by his minions' incapability which has kept him away from the limelight, he has built a transmogrifier — a machine which mutates minions.

Each minion has an intrinsic characteristic value (similar to our DNA), which is an integer. The transmogrifier adds an integer  **K**  to each of the minions' characteristic value.

Gru knows that if the new characteristic value of a minion is divisible by 7, then it will have Wolverine-like mutations.

Given the initial characteristic integers of  **N**  minions, all of which are then transmogrified, find out how many of them become Wolverine-like.

### Input Format

The first line contains one integer,  **T**, which is the number of test cases.
Each test case contains of $2$ lines of input.

- The first line contains two integers N and K, as described in the statement
- The next line contains N integers, which denote the initial characteristic values for the minions
### Output Format

For each testcase, output one integer in a new line, which is the number of Wolverine-like minions after the transmogrification.

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ K ≤ 100
- All initial characteristic values lie between 1 and 105, both inclusive.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
1
5 10
2 4 1 35 1

```

```
1
```

### Explanation:

After transmogrification, the characteristic values become {12,14,11,45,11}, out of which only 14 is divisible by 7. So only the second minion becomes Wolverine-like.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n,k;
        cin >> n >> k;
        
        int wolverine_count =0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++) {
        int characterstics_value;
        cin  >> characterstics_value;
        
        if((characterstics_value + k) % 7 == 0) {
            wolverine_count++;
        }
        }
        cout << wolverine_count << endl;
    }
    return 0;
    
	// your code goes here

}

```
