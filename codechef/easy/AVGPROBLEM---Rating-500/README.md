## Problem

### Greater Average

You are given $3$ numbers $A, B,$ and $C$.

Determine whether the  **average**  of $A$ and $B$ is  **strictly greater**  than $C$ or not?

 **NOTE:**  Average of $A$ and $B$ is defined as $\frac{(A+B)}{2}$. For example, average of $5$ and $9$ is $7$, average of $5$ and $8$ is $6.5$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of $3$ integers $A, B,$ and $C$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if average of $A$ and $B$ is strictly greater than $C$, `NO` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `YeS`, `yEs`, `yes` and `YES` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq A, B, C \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
5 9 6
5 8 6
5 7 6
4 9 8
3 7 2

```

```
YES
YES
NO
NO
YES

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The average value of $5$ and $9$ is $7$ which is strictly greater than $6$.

 **Test case $2$:**  The average value of $5$ and $8$ is $6.5$ which is strictly greater than $6$.

 **Test case $3$:**  The average value of $5$ and $7$ is $6$ which is not strictly greater than $6$.

 **Test case $4$:**  The average value of $4$ and $9$ is $6.5$ which is not strictly greater than $8$.

 **Test case $5$:**  The average value of $3$ and $7$ is $5$ which is strictly greater than $2$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int  t,a,b,c;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> a >> b >> c;
        if(a+b >2*c){
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}

```
