## Problem

### Battery Low

Chef's phone shows a Battery Low notification if the battery level is $15 \%$ or less.

Given that the battery level of Chef's phone is $X \%$, determine whether it would show a Battery low notification.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains a single line of input, an integer $X$, denoting the battery level of the phone.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line $\texttt{Yes}$, if the battery level is $15 \%$ or below. Otherwise, print $\text{No}$.

You may print each character of $\texttt{Yes}$ and $\text{No}$ in uppercase or lowercase (for example, $\texttt{YeS}$, $\texttt{YES}$, $\texttt{yes}$ will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
### Subtasks

 **Subtask #1 (100 points):**  original constraints

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
15
3
65
```

```
Yes
Yes
No
```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  The battery level is $15$. Thus, it would show a battery low notification.

 **Test Case 2:**  The battery level is $3$, which is less than $15$. Thus, it would show a battery low notification.

 **Test Case 3:**  The battery level is $65$, which is greater than $15$. Thus, it would not show a battery low notification.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,x;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> x;
        if(x<=15){
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}

```
