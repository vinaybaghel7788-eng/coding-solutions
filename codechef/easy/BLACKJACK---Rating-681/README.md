## Problem

### Blackjack

Chef is playing a variant of Blackjack, where $3$ numbers are drawn and each number lies between $1$ and $10$ (with both $1$ and $10$ inclusive). Chef wins the game when the sum of these $3$ numbers is exactly $21$.

Given the first two numbers $A$ and $B$, that have been drawn by Chef, what should be $3$-rd number that should be drawn by the Chef in order to win the game?

Note that it is possible that Chef cannot win the game, no matter what is the $3$-rd number. In such cases, report $-1$ as the answer.

### Input Format
- The first line will contain an integer $T$ - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $A$ and $B$ - the first and second number drawn by the Chef.
### Output Format

For each testcase, output the $3$-rd number that should be drawn by the Chef in order to win the game. Output $-1$ if it is not possible for the Chef to win the game.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A, B \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 10
1 5
4 9
```

```
10
-1
8
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$** : The first two numbers are $1$ and $10$. If the third number will be $10$, the resulting sum will be $1 + 10 + 10 = 21$. So Chef will win the game if the third number is $10$.

 **Test case $2$** : The first two numbers are $1$ and $5$. There is no number between $1$ and $10$, that can make the resulting sum $21$. Hence, the answer will be $-1$ in this test case.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int A, B;
        cin >> A >> B;
        
        int C = 21 - A - B;
        if (C >= 1 && C <= 10) {
            cout << C << "\n";
        } else {
            cout << -1 << "\n";
        }
        
    }
	// your code goes here

}

```
