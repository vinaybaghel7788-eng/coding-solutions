## Problem

### Is the Score Consistent

Chef is watching a football match. The current score is $A:B$, that is, team $1$ has scored $A$ goals and team $2$ has scored $B$ goals. Chef wonders if it is possible for the score to become $C:D$ at a later point in the game (i.e. team $1$ has scored $C$ goals and team $2$ has scored $D$ goals). Can you help Chef by answering his question?

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers $A$ and $B$ - the intial number of goals team $1$ and team $2$ have scored respectively.
- The second line of each test case contains two integers $C$ and $D$ - the final number of goals team $1$ and team $2$ must be able to score respectively.
### Output Format

For each testcase, output `POSSIBLE` if it is possible for the score to become $C:D$ at a later point in the game, `IMPOSSIBLE` otherwise.

You may print each character of `POSSIBLE` and `IMPOSSIBLE` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `possible`, `pOSsiBLe`, `Possible` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $0 \leq A,B,C,D \leq 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
1 5
3 5
3 4
2 6
2 2
2 2

```

```
POSSIBLE
IMPOSSIBLE
POSSIBLE

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case 1:**  The current score is $1:5$. If team $1$ scores $2$ more goals, the score will become $3:5$. Thus $3:5$ is a possible score.

 **Test case 2:**  The current score is $3:4$. It can be proven that no non-negative pair of integers $(x, y)$ exists such that if team $1$ scores $x$ more goals and team $2$ scores $y$ more goals the score becomes $2:6$ from $3:4$. Thus in this case $2:6$ is an impossible score.

 **Test case 3:**  The current score is already $2:2$. Hence it is a possible score.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,a,b,c,d;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
        if(a<=c && b<=d){
            cout << "possible" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "impossible" << endl;
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}

```
