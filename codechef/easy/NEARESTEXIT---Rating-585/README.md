## Problem

### Nearest Exit

There are two exits in a bus with $100$ seats:

- First exit is located beside seat number $1$.
- Second exit is located beside seat number $100$.

Seats are arranged in a straight line from $1$ to $100$ with equal spacing between any $2$ adjacent seats.

A passenger prefers to choose the nearest exit while leaving the bus.

Determine the exit taken by passenger sitting on seat $X$.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists a single integer $X$, denoting the seat number.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `LEFT` if the passenger chooses the exit beside seat $1$, `RIGHT` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `LEFT`, `lEft`, `left`, and `lEFT` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
6
1
50
100
30
51
73

```

```
LEFT
LEFT
RIGHT
LEFT
RIGHT
RIGHT

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The exit is located beside seat $1$. Hence, the passenger can take this exit without moving to any other seat.

 **Test case $2$:**  To take exit at seat $1$, the passenger needs to move $49$ seats. However, to take the exit at seat $100$, the passenger needs to move $50$ seats. Thus, exit at seat $1$ is closer.

 **Test case $3$:**  The exit is located beside seat $100$. Hence, the passenger can take this exit without moving to any other seat.

 **Test case $4$:**  To take exit at seat $1$, the passenger needs to move $29$ seats. However, to take the exit at seat $100$, the passenger needs to move $70$ seats. Thus, exit at seat $1$ is closer.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,x;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> x;
        if(x<=50){
            cout<< "left" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "right" << endl;
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}
