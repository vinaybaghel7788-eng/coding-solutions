# QUALIFY - Rating 594

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

### Qualify the round

In a coding contest, there are two types of problems:

- Easy problems, which are worth $1$ point each
- Hard problems, which are worth $2$ points each

To qualify for the next round, a contestant must score at least $X$ points. Chef solved $A$ Easy problems and $B$ Hard problems. Will Chef qualify or not?

### Input Format
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing three space-separated integers — $X, A$, and $B$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output a new line containing the answer — `Qualify` if Chef qualifies for the next round, and `NotQualify` otherwise.

Each character of the answer may be printed in either uppercase or lowercase. For example, if the answer is `Qualify`, outputs such as `qualify`, `quALiFy`, `QUALIFY` and `QuAlIfY` will also be accepted as correct.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq X \leq 100$
- $0 \leq A, B \leq 100$
### Sample 1:

Output

```
3
15 9 3
5 3 0
6 2 8

```

```
Qualify
NotQualify
Qualify

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  Chef solved $9$ easy problems and $3$ hard problems, making his total score $9\cdot 1 + 3\cdot 2 = 15$. He needs at least $15$ points to qualify, which he has and hence he qualifies.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef solved $3$ easy problems and $0$ hard problems, making his total score $3\cdot 1 + 0\cdot 2 = 3$. He needs at least $5$ points to qualify, which he doesn't have and hence doesn't qualify.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Chef solved $2$ easy problems and $8$ hard problems, making his total score $2\cdot 1 + 8\cdot 2 = 18$. He needs at least $6$ points to qualify, which he has and hence he qualifies.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int x,a,b;
        cin  >> x >> a >> b;
        int total_points = a+2*b;
        if(total_points >= x){
            cout << "Qualify" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "notQualify" << endl;
        }
    }
    return 0;
    
	// your code goes here

}

```
