## Problem

### Elections in Chefland

Election season has started in Chefland and the election commission wants to know the count of eligible voters.

There are $N$ people in Chefland where the age of the $i^{th}$ person in $A_i$.
Given that a person needs to be  **at least**  $X$ years old to vote, find the number of eligible voters.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of multiple lines of input. The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $X$ — the number of people in Chefland, and the minimum age required for a person to vote in Chefland. The next line contains $N$ space-separated integers, where the $i^{th}$ integer denotes the age of the $i^{th}$ person.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the number of eligible voters in Chefland.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 200$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A_i, X \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
4 3
5 3 1 2
3 2
1 3 4
4 2
2 1 2 4
5 6
1 2 3 4 5

```

```
2
2
3
0

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The minimum age to vote in Chefland is $3$ years. There are $2$ people with age greater than equal to $3$ and thus, there are $2$ eligible voters.

 **Test case $2$:**  The minimum age to vote in Chefland is $2$ years. There are $2$ people with age greater than equal to $2$ and thus, there are $2$ eligible voters.

 **Test case $3$:**  The minimum age to vote in Chefland is $2$ years. There are $3$ people with age greater than equal to $2$ and thus, there are $3$ eligible voters.

 **Test case $4$:**  The minimum age to vote in Chefland is $6$ years. There are no people with age greater than equal to $6$ and thus, there are no eligible voters.

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n,x;
        cin >> n >> x;
        
        int eligible_count =0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            int age;
            cin >> age;
            if(age>=x){
                eligible_count++;
            }
        }
            cout << eligible_count << endl;
}
return 0;

}

```
