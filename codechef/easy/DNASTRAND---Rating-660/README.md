## Problem

### Complementary Strand in a DNA

You are given the sequence of Nucleotides of one strand of DNA through a string $S$ of length $N$. $S$ contains the character $A, T, C,$ and $G$ only.

Chef knows that:

- $A$ is complementary to $T$.
- $T$ is complementary to $A$.
- $C$ is complementary to $G$.
- $G$ is complementary to $C$.

Using the string $S$, determine the sequence of the complementary strand of the DNA.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- First line of each test case contains an integer $N$ - denoting the length of string $S$.
- Second line contains $N$ characters denoting the string $S$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the string containing $N$ characters - sequence of nucleotides of the complementary strand.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $S$ contains A, T, C, and G only
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
4
ATCG
4
GTCC
5
AAAAA
3
TAC

```

```
TAGC
CAGG
TTTTT
ATG

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Based on the rules, the complements of `A`, `T`, `C`, and `G` are `T`, `A`, `G`, and `C` respectively. Thus, the complementary string of the given string `ATCG` is `TAGC`.

 **Test case $2$:**  Based on the rules, the complements of `G`, `T`, and `C` are `C`, `A`, and `G` respectively. Thus, the complementary string of the given string `GTCC` is `CAGG`.

 **Test case $3$:**  Based on the rules, the complement of `A` is `T`. Thus, the complementary string of the given string `AAAAA` is `TTTTT`.

 **Test case $4$:**  Based on the rules, the complements of `T`, `A`, and `C` are `A`, `T`, and `G` respectively. Thus, the complementary string of the given string `TAC` is `ATG`.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n;;
        cin >> n;
        string s;
        cin >> s;
        for(int i=0;i<n; i++){
            if(s[i]=='A'){
                s[i]='T';
            } else if(s[i]=='T'){
                s[i]='A';
            } else if(s[i]=='C'){
                s[i]='G';
            } else if(s[i]=='G') {
                s[i]='C';
            }
        }
        cout << s << endl;
    }
	return 0;

}

```
