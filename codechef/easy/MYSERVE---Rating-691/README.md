## Problem

### It is My Serve

Alice and Bob are playing a game of table tennis where irrespective of the point scored, every player makes $2$ consecutive serves before the service changes. Alice makes the first serve of the match. Therefore the first $2$ serves will be made by Alice, then the next $2$ serves will be made by Bob and so on.

Let's consider the following example match for more clarity:

- Alice makes the $1^{st}$ serve.
- Let us assume, Bob wins this point. (Score is $0$ for Alice and $1$ for Bob)
- Alice makes the $2^{nd}$ serve.
- Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is $1$ for Alice and $1$ for Bob)
- Bob makes the $3^{rd}$ serve.
- Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is $2$ for Alice and $1$ for Bob)
- Bob makes the $4^{th}$ serve.
- Let us assume, Alice wins this point. (Score is $3$ for Alice and $1$ for Bob)
- Alice makes the $5^{th}$ serve.
- And the game continues $\ldots$

After the score reaches $P$ and $Q$ for Alice and Bob respectively, both the players forgot whose serve it is. Help them determine whose service it is.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers $P$ and $Q$ — the score of Alice and Bob respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, determine which player's (`Alice` or `Bob`) serve it is.

You may print each character of `Alice` and `Bob` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `Bob`, `BOB`, `boB` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 200$
- $0 \le P, Q \le 10$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
0 0
0 2
2 2
4 7

```

```
Alice
Bob
Alice
Bob

```

### Explanation:
- Test Case 1: Since no points have been scored yet, this is the first serve of the match. Alice makes the $1^{st}$ serve of the match.
- Test Case 2: Two points have been scored yet. Thus, it is the third serve of the match. Bob makes the $3^{rd}$ serve of the match.
- Test Case 3: Four points have been scored yet. Thus, it is the fifth serve of the match. Alice makes the $5^{th}$ serve of the match.
- Test Case 4: Eleven points have been scored yet. Thus, it is the twelfth serve of the match. Bob makes the $12^{th}$ serve of the match.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,p,q;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> p >> q;
        int t = (p+q)/2;
        if(t%2==0){
            cout << "alice" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "bob" << endl;
        }
        
    }
	// your code goes here

}
