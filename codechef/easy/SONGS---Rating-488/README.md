## Problem

### Dominant Army

In the medieval age, there were $3$ kingdoms $A$, $B$, and $C$. The army of these kingdom had $N_A$, $N_B$, and $N_C$ soldiers respectively.

You are given that an army with $X$ soldiers can defeat an army with $Y$ soldiers only if $X \gt Y$.

An army is said to be  **dominant**  if it can defeat both the other armies  **combined**. For example, kingdom $C$'s army will be dominant only if $N_C > N_A + N_B$.

Determine whether any of the armies is  **dominant**  or not.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $N_A$, $N_B$, and $N_C$ - the number of warriors in the armies of kingdoms $A$, $B$, and $C$ respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if any of the armies is dominant. Otherwise, output `NO`.

You may print each character of `YES` and `NO` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `Yes` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N_A, N_B, N_C \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
15 5 6
12 13 16
1 1 100
10 10 20

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  The kingdom $A$'s army is dominant since $15 > 5 + 6$.

 **Test case $2$:**  We can observe that none of the armies is dominant.

 **Test case $3$:**  The kingdom $C$'s army is dominant since $100 > 1 + 1$.

 **Test case $4$:**  We can observe that none of the armies is dominant. Note that the kingdom $C$'s army is not dominant since $20 \le 10 + 10$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,x,y,z;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> x >> y >> z;
        if(x>y+z || y>x+z || z >x+y){
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
    }
	return 0;

}

```
