## Problem

### Maximise the Tastiness

Chef is making a dish that consists of exactly two ingredients. He has four ingredients $A, B, C$ and $D$ with tastiness $a, b, c,$ and $d$ respectively. He can use either $A$ or $B$ as the first ingredient and either $C$ or $D$ as the second ingredient.

The tastiness of a dish is the sum of tastiness of its ingredients. Find the  **maximum**  possible tastiness of the dish that the chef can prepare.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- The first and only line of each test case contains four space-separated integers $a, b, c,$ and $d$ — the tastiness of the four ingredients.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum possible tastiness of the dish that chef can prepare.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq a, b, c, d \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
3 5 6 2
16 15 5 4

```

```
11
21
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef can prepare a dish with ingredients $B$ and $C$ with a tastiness of $5+6=11$.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef can prepare a dish with ingredients $A$ and $C$ with a tastiness of $16+5=21$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int a,b,c,d;
        cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
        int total_taste = 0;
        
        total_taste = max(a,b) + max(c,d);
        cout << total_taste << endl;
    }
    return 0;
    
	// your code goes here

}

```
