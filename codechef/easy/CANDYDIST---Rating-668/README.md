## Problem

### Candy Distribution

Chef has $N$ candies. He has to distribute them to exactly $M$ of his friends such that each friend gets  **equal**  number of candies and each friend gets  **even**  number of candies. Determine whether it is possible to do so.

 **NOTE:**  Chef will not take any candies himself and will distribute  **all**  the candies.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $N$ and $M$, the number of candies and the number of friends.
### Output Format

For each test case, the output will consist of a single line containing `Yes` if Chef can distribute the candies as per the conditions and `No` otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `yes`, `Yes`, `yEs`, and `YES` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N,M \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
9 3
4 1
4 2
8 3
```

```
No
Yes
Yes
No
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since Chef has $9$ candies and $3$ friends, each friend will get $\frac{9}{3} = 3$ candies. Since $3$ is not even, Chef doesn't satisfy the conditions.

 **Test case $2$:**  Since Chef has $4$ candies and $1$ friend, each friend will get $\frac{4}{1} = 4$ candies. Since $4$ is even, Chef satisfies all the conditions.

 **Test case $3$:**  Since Chef has $4$ candies and $2$ friends, each friend will get $\frac{4}{2} = 2$ candies. Since $2$ is even, Chef satisfies all the conditions.

 **Test case $4$:**  Since Chef has $8$ candies and $3$ friends. Since Chef won't be able to distribute all the candies equally, Chef does not satisfy all the conditions.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,n,m;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> n >> m;
        
        if(n%2==0){
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}

```
