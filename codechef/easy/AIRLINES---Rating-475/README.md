## Problem

### Codechef Airlines

Chef has opened a new airline. Chef has $10$ airplanes where each airplane has a capacity of $X$ passengers.
On the first day itself, $Y$ people are willing to book a seat in  **any one**  of Chef's airplanes.

Given that Chef charges $Z$ rupees for each ticket, find the  **maximum**  amount he can earn on the first day.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three space-separated integers $X, Y,$ and $Z$ — the capacity of each airplane, the number of people willing to book a seat in any one of Chef's airplanes on the first day, and the cost of each seat respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line, the  **maximum**  amount Chef can earn on the first day.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X, Y, Z \leq 100$
### Sample 1:

```
4
2 15 10
1 10 1
5 60 100
1 11 7

```

```
150
10
5000
70

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $2$ passengers. Thus, there are $20$ seats available in total.
There are $15$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have enough seats for everyone, all $15$ people can book their seats and pay $10$ rupees each. The total money Chef earns is $15\cdot 10 = 150$.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $1$ passenger. Thus, there are $10$ seats available in total.
There are $10$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have enough seats for everyone, all $10$ people can book their seats and pay $1$ rupee each. The total money Chef earns is $10\cdot 1 = 10$.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $5$ passengers. Thus, there are $50$ seats available in total.
There are $60$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have only $50$ seats, only $50$ people can book their seats and pay $100$ rupees each. The total money Chef earns is $50\cdot 100 = 5000$.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef has $10$ airplanes and each airplane has a capacity of $1$ passenger. Thus, there are $10$ seats available in total.
There are $11$ people who want to book a seat. Since we have only $10$ seats, only $10$ people can book their seats and pay $7$ rupees each. The total money Chef earns is $10\cdot 7 = 70$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,x,y,z;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> x >> y >> z;
        cout << min(y, 10*x) * z << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
