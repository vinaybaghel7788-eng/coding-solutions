## Problem

### Test Score

In a test, there are $N$ problems, each carrying $X$ marks.
In each problem, Chef either received $X$ marks or $0$ marks.

Determine whether is it possible for Chef to achieve  **exactly**  $Y$ marks.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of three integers $N, X,$ and $Y$, the number of problems, the maximum score for each problem, and the score Chef wants.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `YES` if Chef can achieve exactly $Y$ marks, `NO` otherwise.

You can print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings `Yes`, `YES`, `yes`, and `yEs`, are all considered identical.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 10$
- $1 \leq X \leq 10$
- $0 \leq Y \leq 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
1 8 4
3 6 12
4 5 0
10 10 100
8 5 36

```

```
NO
YES
YES
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  There is no way for Chef to score exactly $4$ marks.

 **Test case $2$:**  Chef can score $12$ marks by receiving $6$ marks in $2$ problems and $0$ marks in $1$ problem.

 **Test case $3$:**  Chef can score $0$ marks by receiving $0$ marks in each of the $4$ problems.

 **Test case $4$:**  Chef can score $100$ marks by receiving $10$ marks in each of the $10$ problems.

 **Test case $5$:**  There is no way for Chef to score exactly $36$ marks.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n,x,y;
        cin >> n >> x >> y;
        if(y%x==0 && y <=n*x){
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
        
    }
    return 0;
    
	// your code goes here

}

```
