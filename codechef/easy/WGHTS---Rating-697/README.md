## Problem

### Weights

Chef is playing with weights. He has an object weighing $W$ units. He also has three weights each of $X, Y,$ and $Z$ units respectively. Help him determine whether he can measure the  **exact**  weight of the object with one or more of these weights.

If it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, print `YES`, otherwise print `NO`.

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of single line containing a four positive integers $W, X, Y,$ and $Z$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line `YES` if it is possible to measure the weight of object with one or more of these weights, otherwise print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `yes`, `YES`, `Yes`, and `yeS` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^4$
- $1 \leq W, X, Y, Z \leq 10^5$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
5 2 1 6
7 9 7 2
20 8 10 12
20 10 11 12

```

```
NO
YES
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case $1$:**  It is not possible to measure $5$ units using any combination of given weights.

 **Test Case $2$:**  Chef can use the second weight of $7$ units to measure the object exactly.

 **Test Case $3$:**  Chef can use combination of first and third weights to measure $8+12=20$ units.

 **Test Case $4$:**  Chef cannot measure $20$ units of weight using any combination of given weights.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,w,x,y,z;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> w >> x >> y >>z;
        if(w==x||w==y||w==z||w==x+y||w==y+z||w==z+x||w==x+y+z){
            cout <<"yes" << endl;
        } else{
             cout <<"no" << endl;
        }
    }
	// your code goes here

}

```
