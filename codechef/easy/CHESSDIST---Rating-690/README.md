## Problem

### Chessboard Distance

The Chessboard Distance for any two points $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$ on a Cartesian plane is defined as $max(|X_1 - X_2|, |Y_1 - Y_2|)$.

You are given two points $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$. Output their Chessboard Distance.

Note that, $|P|$ denotes the absolute value of integer $P$. For example, $|-4| = 4$ and $|7| = 7$.

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case consists of a single line of input containing $4$ space separated integers - $X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2$ - as defined in the problem statement.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the chessboard distance between $(X_1, Y_1)$ and $(X_2, Y_2)$

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2 \leq 10^5$

2 4 5 1
5 5 5 3
1 4 3 3

```

```
3
2
2

```

### Explanation:
- In the first case, the distance between $(2, 4)$ and $(5, 1)$ is $max(|2- 5|, |4 - 1|) = max(|-3|, |3|) = 3$.
- In the second case, the distance between $(5, 5)$ and $(5, 3)$ is $max(|5- 5|, |5 - 3|) = max(|0|, |2|) = 2$.
- In the third case, the distance between $(1, 4)$ and $(3, 3)$ is $max(|1- 3|, |4 - 3|) = max(|-2|, |1|) = 2$.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,a,b,c,d;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> a >> b >> c >> d;
        cout << max(abs(a-c),abs(b-d)) << endl;
    }
	// your code goes here

}
