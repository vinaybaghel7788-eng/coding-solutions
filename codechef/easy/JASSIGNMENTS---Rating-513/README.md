## Problem

### Janmansh and Assignments

Janmansh has to submit $3$ assignments for Chingari before $10$ pm and he starts to do the assignments at $X$ pm. Each assignment takes him $1$ hour to complete. Can you tell whether he'll be able to complete all assignments on time or not?

### Input Format
- The first line will contain $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $X$ - the time when Janmansh starts doing the assignments.
### Output Format

For each test case, output `Yes` if he can complete the assignments on time. Otherwise, output `No`.

You may print each character of `Yes` and `No` in uppercase or lowercase (for example, `yes`, `yEs`, `YES` will be considered identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 10$
- $1 \le X \le 9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
7
9

```

```
Yes
No

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case-1:**  He can start at $7$pm and finish by $10$ pm. Therefore he can complete the assignments.

 **Test case-2:**  He can not complete all the $3$ assignments if he starts at $9$ pm.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t,x;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        cin >> x;
        if(x<=7){
            cout << "yes" << endl;
        } else{
            cout << "no" << endl;
        }
        
    }
	// your code goes here

}
