## Problem

### Finding Shoes

Chef has $N$ friends. Chef promised that he would gift a pair of shoes (consisting of one left shoe and one right shoe) to each of his $N$ friends. Chef was about to go to the marketplace to buy shoes, but he suddenly remembers that he already had $M$ left shoes.

What is the minimum number of extra shoes that Chef will have to buy to ensure that he is able to gift a pair of shoes to each of his $N$ friends?

For example, if $N = 2$, $M = 4$, then Chef already has $4$ left shoes, so he must buy $2$ extra right shoes to form $2$ pairs of shoes.

Therefore Chef must buy at least $2$ extra shoes to  **ensure**  that he is able to get $N = 2$ pairs of shoes.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $T$ - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first line of each test case contains two integers $N$ and $M$ - the number of Chef's friends and the number of left shoes Chef has.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of extra shoes that Chef will have to buy to ensure that he is able to get $N$ pairs of shoes.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 100$
- $1 \leq N \leq 100$
- $0 \leq M \leq 100$

5

```

### Explanation:

 **Test Case 1:**  Discussed in the problem statement

 **Test Case 2:**  Chef initially has no left shoes. He must buy $6$ more left shoes and $6$ more right shoes to form $6$ pairs of shoes.

 **Test Case 3:**  Chef initially has $3$ left shoes. He must buy $1$ more left shoe and $4$ more right shoes to form $4$ pairs of shoes.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n,m;
        cin >> n >>m;
        cout << n + max(0,n-m) << endl;
        
    }
	// your code goes here

}
